What should you do after Hoon School?  Well, presumably you've become interested
in building apps on Urbit, and certainly knowing the language is a prerequisite.
But apps require knowing the platform as a platform—what system services and
affordances exist, how to hook up a front-end user interface, and how to build
apps that interoperate with each other.

The Urbit Foundation offered Hoon School Live as a reboot of previous live Hoon
educational efforts, including Hooniversity and Hoon 101.  HSL consisted of
synchronous livestream sessions, homework, and office hours, and concluded with
a competition (on the results of which more soon).  61 participants completed
HSL and received finisher `%gorae`.

In July, the Urbit Foundation will follow up HSL with App School Live, another
synchronous cohort class based on the App School guides (formerly known as the
Gall Guides).  We will cover the structure of an Urbit backend app, Urbit OS
system calls, app coordination across multiple ships, how to build a front-end,
and more.

Most—but not all—Urbit app development has focused thus far on social media and
cryptocurrency applications.  This makes sense, and it's a strength of the
current Urbit platform primitives.  But so much more is possible:  games, of
course, but also life management, instrumentation, CLIs, data visualization, and
so forth.  With Urbit's peer-to-peer distribution system, there are no
gatekeepers, and anyone can start their own app store.

At the same time as ASL, the Urbit Foundation is holding a hackathon with prizes
to be unveiled at [Assembly Miami](https://assembly.urbit.org).  We're excited
to see what you're going to build.  If you're not sure how to produce your
vision yet, start with App School Live and then peruse the submissions for
current [grant projects](https://urbit.org/grants) to see how others are
successfully building apps.

If you are interested in participating in App School Live, drop us a line at
[this registration

or join us on Mars at ~hiddev-dannut/new-hooniverse.  We'll start on Tuesday,
July 12 and run through August 23.
