Periodically, the Urbit Foundation will offer synchronous cohort classes which
cover the [App School](/guides/core/hoon-school) curriculum.

App School focuses on how to build a backend Gall agent, then on connecting it
to a React-based front-end.  When you're done, you'll be able to produce and
distribute your own Urbit apps.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then App School Live
will be a good fit for you.

The next cohort for App School Live will run from Tuesday July 12 until Tuesday
August 23.  The live session will meet at 8:30 p.m. Central Daylight Time, but
recordings will be posted.

- [Complete this form](https://forms.gle/3c8xBubvSiQfj7Tr6) to get on our
  mailing list about that opportunity.

Until then, feel free to work through the [App School
docs](/guides/core/app-school).


##  What will you learn?

### `lesson0`.  A Simple Agent.

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Produce a minimalist Gall agent.
- Employ the `default-agent` library.
- Employ the `%dbug` agent wrapper.
- Define entropy and its source.
- Utilize `eny` in a random number generator (`og`).
- Distinguish insecure hashing (`mug`) from secure hashing (`shax` and friends).

### `lesson1`.  Arvo Services.

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain Arvo as a state machine and event log.
- Explain Kelvin versioning and identify the system components that require this approach.
- Explain the services Ames provides to the system.
- Diagram the architecture of Ames as a network.
- Explain the services Behn provides to the system.
- Explain the services Clay provides to the system.
- Identify key Clay artifacts:  desks, marks, etc.
- Explain the services Dill provides to the system.
- Explain the services Eyre provides to the system.
- Explain the services Gall provides to the system.
- Explain the services Iris provides to the system.
- Explain the services Jael provides to the system.
- Enumerate the secrets Jael tracks.
- Explain the services Khan provides to the system.

You will know the runes:

- `/?`
- `!?`
- `.^`

### `lesson2`.  Agents.

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Produce an advanced Gall agent without a front-end interface.
- Explain how subscriptions work and use them.

### `lesson3`.  Passing Data.

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Diagram how marks convert nouns.
- Explain the use of the `++grab`, `++grow`, and `++grad` arms.
- Produce a simple mark.

You will know the runes:

- `/*`
- `;;`

### `lesson4`.  React Front-End.

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Interact with Urbit using the Javascript API.
- Produce an advanced agent with a front-end interface.
- Explain the role of a `%glob` and produce one.

We _are not_ teaching React and JavaScript.  If you are not comfortable with
front-end platforms, you should still be able to follow along for this lesson,
then circle back around later with an outside tutorial.

### `lesson5`.  Threads.

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Use Spider to dispatch and manage threads.

### `lesson6`.  Production Apps.

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Instrument unit tests for a Gall agent.
- Produce a desk suitable for distribution (with a docket file).
- Explain elements of a docket file.
- Set up a continuous integration pipeline to test Gall agents and other published code.
