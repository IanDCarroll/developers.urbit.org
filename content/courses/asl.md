Periodically, the Urbit Foundation will offer synchronous cohort classes which
cover the [App School](/guides/core/hoon-school) curriculum.

App School focuses on how to build a backend Gall agent, then on connecting it
to a React-based front-end.  When you're done, you'll be able to produce and
distribute your own Urbit apps.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then App School Live
will be a good fit for you.

The next cohort for App School Live will run from Tuesday July 12 until Tuesday
August 23.  The live session will meet at 8:30 p.m. Central Daylight Time, but
recordings will be posted.

  mailing list about that opportunity.

Until then, feel free to work through the [App School
docs](/guides/core/app-school).
