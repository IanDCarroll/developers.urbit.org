Periodically, the Urbit Foundation will offer synchronous cohort classes which
cover the [App School](/guides/core/hoon-school) curriculum.

App School focuses on how to build a backend Gall agent, then on connecting it
to a React-based front-end.  When you're done, you'll be able to produce and
distribute your own Urbit apps.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then App School Live
will be a good fit for you.  We seek to offer it a few times a year; at the
current time, we anticipate that we will next offer it in July 2022 then in
early 2023.

  mailing list about that opportunity.

Until then, feel free to work through the [App School
docs](/guides/core/app-school).
