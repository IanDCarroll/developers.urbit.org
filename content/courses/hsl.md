Periodically, the Urbit Foundation has offered synchronous cohort classes which
cover the [Hoon School](/guides/core/hoon-school) curriculum.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then Hoon School Live
will be a good fit for you.  We seek to offer it a few times a year.

The current/last cohort began after [Assembly 2022](https://assembly.urbit.org) on
September 29, 2022.  We will have another HSL cohort in spring 2023.

  mailing list about the next opportunity.

Until then, feel free to work through the [Hoon School
docs](/guides/core/hoon-school).
