#   Hoon School Live

Periodically, the Urbit Foundation has offered synchronous cohort classes which
cover the [Hoon School](/guides/core/hoon-school) curriculum.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then Hoon School Live
will be a good fit for you.  We seek to offer it a few times a year; at the
current time, we anticipate that we will next offer it in the fall after
[Assembly 2022](https://assembly.urbit.org).

- [Complete this form](https://forms.gle/V1jKKEqcsayDx6Hi6) to get on our
  mailing list about that opportunity.

Until then, feel free to work through the [Hoon School
docs](/guides/core/hoon-school).
