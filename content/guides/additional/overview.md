Once you have mastered the content of [Hoon School](/guides/core/hoon-school)
and [App School](/guides/core/app-school), you can venture into more advanced
application development topics like thread management, or take a look at how
the runtime implements jet-accelerated code.

Other material, like documentation for the Graph Store collection of social
media primitives, are hosted directly in the `%docs` app on Urbit.  To access such internal documentation, install the app from ~pocwet in the Grid interface or at the Dojo command line:

```hoon
|install ~pocwet %docs
```
