### [4. Client-side Integration Guide (~1 day)](https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/eyre/eyre)

The vane eyre allows clients to interact with Urbit over an HTTP interface. Urbit’s architecture is organized around command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), which makes heavy use of pub/sub patterns. Working with this API is different than more typical request/response architecture, and this guide gives you a comprehensive overview of how to do so.

### [Guide to Working with JSON](https://github.com/urbit/urbit.org/pull/1131)

JSON is a dynamically-defined datastructure, and Hoon is a statically-typed language, which means that the two don’t play together really well. This guide gives a comprehensive overview of how to parse and serialize JSON from Hoon.

### [Graph Store Tutorial](https://urbit.org/docs/userspace/graph-store/overview)

Graph store is a gall agent that’s designed to be a general-purpose database for storing graph-like data.

This guide walks you through its architecture and implementation, and then shows you how to use it as a data store for your own application.
