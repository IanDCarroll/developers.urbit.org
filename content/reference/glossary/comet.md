A **comet** is a kind of [ship](/reference/glossary/ship) on the [Ames](/reference/glossary/ames) network which
may be quickly generated by anyone and which are virtually unlimited. They have
many uses, including but not limited to:
- free identities for new users to try things out before deciding to purchase a [planet](/reference/glossary/planet).
- bots
- remaining anonymous
- testing software

Comets have nearly all the same capabilities as a planet. The restrictions they
do possess are technical constraints of the system due primarily to the fact that they
have no presence on [Azimuth](/reference/glossary/azimuth), rather than purposefully placed
blockades.
 - They may not [change their networking keys](/reference/glossary/bridge).
 - They may not spawn [moons](/reference/glossary/moon).
 - They must initiate all direct messages with other ships.
The last constraint has a workaround slated. If you wish to change your
networking keys, we suggest generating a new comet. Moons are impossible for
comets due to the structure of the address space.

Some groups on [Landscape](/reference/glossary/landscape) may not allow comet membership, but this is rare.
