A `%gift` [card](/reference/glossary/card) is an effect produced by
[agents](/reference/glossary/agent) and [threads](/reference/glossary/thread).
It is a *response* to a request from another agent or
[vane](/reference/glossary/vane), as opposed to a `%pass` card, which is a
*request*. The main kind of gift is a [fact](/reference/glossary/fact), which is
an update given to subscribers.
