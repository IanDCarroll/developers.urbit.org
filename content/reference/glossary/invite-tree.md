The **Invite Tree** is the state stored by the [Delegated Sending](/docs/glossary/delegated-sending) contract on [Azimuth](/docs/glossary/azimuth), and is a record of who gave a [planet](/docs/glossary/planet) to whom. This allows for community applications, such as a chat channel for all distantly related planets.
