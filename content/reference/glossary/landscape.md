**Landscape** is a graphical web interface for your [ship](/reference/glossary/ship).
Right now, Landscape allows for social networking functions, such as
participating in IRC-like chats such as `~/~dopzod/urbit-help`, subscribing to
forum-like pages of other ships called Notebooks, and messaging other ships
directly. It also has weather and clock apps. Landscape is an alternative
messaging interface to the command-line app [Chat](/reference/glossary/chat).

Landscape can be accessed with a browser via
[ship.arvo.network](/reference/glossary/shiparvonetwork) or by `localhost:80`.
You'll be greeted with a login prompt; type `+code` into your
[Dojo](/reference/glossary/dojo), and use the output as your password.
