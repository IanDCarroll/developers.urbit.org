A **mark** is a file-type in the [Clay](/reference/glossary/clay) filesystem. A mark is a file that defines filesystem information such as type, merge routines, diff routines, and patch algorithms.

The [Ford](/reference/glossary/ford) [vane](/reference/glossary/vane) converts data between marks and validates data into marks.
