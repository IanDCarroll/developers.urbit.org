A **ship** is an instance of an Urbit computer that is a peer on the [Arvo](/docs/glossary/arvo) network.

A ship can be one of five classes:

- [comets](/docs/glossary/comet), disposable identities.
- [moons](/docs/glossary/moon), connected devices subordinated to a ship.
- [planets](/docs/glossary/planet), individual users.
- [stars](/docs/glossary/star), network infrastructure nodes.
- [galaxy](/docs/glossary/galaxy), also network infrastructure nodes.

To be able to use the Arvo network, planets, stars, and galaxies must be combined with an [Azimuth](/docs/glossary/azimuth)-based Urbit identity in the form of a [keyfile](/docs/glossary/keyfile).
