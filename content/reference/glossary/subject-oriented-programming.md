The Urbit operating system hews to a conceptual model wherein each expression
takes place in a certain [context](/reference/glossary/context) (the
[subject](/reference/glossary/subject)). While sharing a lot of practicality
with other programming paradigms and platforms, Urbit's model is mathematically
well-defined and unambiguously specified. Every expression of
[Hoon](/reference/glossary/hoon) is evaluated relative to its subject, a piece
of data that represents the environment, or the context, of an expression.
