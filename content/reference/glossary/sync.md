**|sync** sets up a sychronization between two [Clay](/reference/glossary/clay) [desks](/reference/glossary/desk). It is mostly used to distribute kernel updates.

By default, in the [galaxy](/reference/glossary/galaxy)/[star](/reference/glossary/star)/[planet](/reference/glossary/planet)/[moon](/reference/glossary/moon) hierachy, the kids desk of the parent is synchronized with the base desk of the child.
