**Userspace** is composed of [Gall](/reference/glossary/gall)
[agents](/reference/glossary/agent), [threads](/reference/glossary/thread),
[generators](/reference/glossary/generator), front-end resources and other
non-kernel files in [Clay](/reference/glossary/clay). This is in contrast to
[kernelspace](/reference/glossary/kernel), which is composed of
[Arvo](/reference/glossary/arvo), its [vanes](/reference/glossary/vane) (kernel
