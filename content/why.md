title: Why become an Urbit developer?
+++

Urbit is a novel general-purpose computer that’s captivated thousands, and it’s no wonder why—truly novel computing architectures are few and far between, and they tend to be highly transformative. For recent examples, consider iOS and Ethereum. We think Urbit is at least as big of a deal.

Most developers are drawn to Urbit because they’re fascinated by it—this author being no exception. The artful elegance of Nock, Hoon, and Arvo are reason enough for many, but are by no means the only reasons to bother learning Urbit.

For one, Urbit is useful. There are real applications built on it that have properties you simply can’t find elsewhere. Its promise to developers is that distributed peer-to-peer applications, traditionally some of the hardest to build, can be built with ease and simple, understandable architectures. Urbit as a stack stands in stark contrast to the bloated tarpit of complexity that is modern networked software development. WIP

Aside from the lofty philosophical ideals that are at arguable stages of progress, Urbit has a thriving, friendly, helpful community of developers that cooperate out of a shared desire to make programming better and more fun. You’ll find gray-haired industry veterans, new students, beginners to programming, IoT enthusiasts, and degens, …—a wide gamut of hackers. WIP

Being in its early stages of development, Urbit is also an exciting space to develop within—pretty much everything is greenfield, leaving a new future to be invented. WIP
